# Reflection on CP1404 Practicals

1. What did you learn?
   - I learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control and how to manage my projects effectively.

2. What challenges did you face?
   - It was challenging to refactor some of the code to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and use functions properly.

3. What would you do differently next time?
   - I would try to structure my programs with functions from the beginning to avoid difficulties later when refactoring.
